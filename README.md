# Decision Tree Classifier Analysis

## Overview

This repository showcases an analysis using the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm on a banking dataset. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, which is a common classification problem in the banking sector. The analysis involves data preprocessing, training a decision tree model, and evaluating its performance.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps ensure that our data is clean and suitable for modeling:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Model Training

We train a Decision Tree Classifier with the following configuration:

```python
DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
```

## Model Evaluation

Post-training, we evaluate the model using accuracy and a detailed classification report:

- Accuracy is used as a measure of the overall performance.
- Precision, recall, and F1-score provide insights into the performance for each class.

## Results

The Decision Tree Classifier yields an accuracy of approximately 87%, with the following classification report:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.94      0.92      0.93       700
           1       0.36      0.42      0.39        73

    accuracy                           0.87       773
   macro avg       0.65      0.67      0.66       773
weighted avg       0.88      0.87      0.88       773
```
